## Engaging Tips

- Ensure your voice is loud enough for everyone to hear before starting the presentation.
  - Wearing a microphone doesn't mean the room has a good sound system. It might be for recording purposes only.
- Face and speak to the audience instead of facing the laptop or presentation.
- Make it in time. Also, leave 5 ~ 10 min for questions.
  - You can tell people to come to you for more questions during break time.
- Clarify the question first before answering.
- Don't read the slides. The audience can read it themselves.
- Put only a little text on the slides. It's hard to read.
- Move around the stage, and don't only stay behind the laptop.
- Don't be afraid to ask the audience to clap their hands, raise their hands, or do something fun.
- Don't be afraid to ask Organizers for help before, after, or/and during the presentation.
